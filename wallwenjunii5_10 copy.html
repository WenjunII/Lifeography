              我是家中唯一的儿子，总是感觉被一群缠烂的笑容包围着。渐渐我便觉得，这是一种正常的状态。似乎我不需要做些什么，甚至只需要安静地待在那里，就可以得到许多东西，当然我也习惯了以笑容和笑声回应他们。我应该也是很开心的吧，这样怎么会不开心？但是我也经常会被打，而且很多时候会被打得好狠，甚至需要奶奶保护我，那里是一个安全的避难所。我也应该是哭得声嘶力竭吧。不知不觉地，我似乎找到了一种生活方式，只要每天完成学校的任务，剩下的时间我就可以去玩了。我渐渐习惯并熟悉这种方式，这样令我的生活变得很畅顺。学校会对学习成绩好并听话的学生进行嘉奖，我集齐了“小队长”、“中队长”、“三好学生”这些称号，也成为了其中一名模范学生。生活中继续总是被一群缠烂的笑容包围着。

              I am the only son in the family and always feel surrounded by a bunch of smiles. Gradually I come to think that this is a normal state. It seems that I don't need to do anything, or even just stay quiet, I still can get a lot of things. And I also get used to responding to them with smiles and laughter. I should be happy, how can I not be happy like that? But I am also often beaten, and many times I will be beaten so much that I even need my grandma to protect me, where it is a safe haven. I should have been crying my eyes out too. Without realizing it, I seem to have found a way of life where, as long as I complete my daily school tasks, I could go play the rest of the time. I gradually get used to this way of life and become familiar with it, and it makes my life very smooth. I am awarded for good academic performance and obedience, by receiving the titles of "Junior Captain", "Squadron Leader" and "Three Good Student". I also become one of the model students. My life continues to be surrounded by a bunch of smiles.
