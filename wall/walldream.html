        I dream of Wenjun, at that time he was still a little boy...I feel like I am him... The dream is long and grows as if it will never end. Actually, I would like to be in this dream forever. I quite like this little boy.

        A sound of a sewing machine comes in the quiet night as my mother concentrates on sewing. I am lying on her soft and warm lap and gradually fall asleep. Time becomes eternal... Until a pair of hands lift me up and put me in my own bed, where it feels a little cold. Can you not do this? Will you still be sewing tomorrow night?
