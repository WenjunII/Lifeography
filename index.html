			I <span class="keyword">dream</span> of Wenjun, at that <span class="keyword">time</span> he was still a <span class="keyword">little boy</span>...I feel like I am him...
			<br>

			The <span class="keyword">dream</span> is long and grows as it will never end. Actually, I would like to be in this <span class="keyword">dream</span> forever. I quite like this <span class="keyword">little boy</span>.

				The sound of a <span class="keyword">sewing machine</span> comes in the quiet night as my mother concentrated on <span class="keyword">sewing</span>. I am lying on her <span class="keyword">soft</span> and <span class="keyword">warm</span> lap and gradually <span class="keyword">fall asleep</span>. <span class="keyword">Time</span> becomes eternal... Until a pair of hands lift me up and put me in my own <span class="keyword">bed</span>, where it feels a little <span class="keyword">cold</span>. Can you not do this? Will you still be <span class="keyword">sewing</span> tomorrow night?

							I am the only <span class="keyword">son</span> in the <span class="keyword">family</span> and always feel surrounded by a bunch of pestering <span class="keyword">smiles</span>. Gradually I come to think that this is a normal state. It seems that I don't need to do anything, or even just stay quiet, I still can get a lot of things. And of course, I get used to rewarding them with <span class="keyword">smiles</span> and <span class="keyword">laughter</span>. I should be <span class="keyword">happy</span>, how can I not be <span class="keyword">happy</span> like that? But I am also often <span class="keyword">beaten</span>, and many times I will be <span class="keyword">beaten</span> so much that I will even hide in the space between the <span class="keyword">refrigerator</span> and the <span class="keyword">cabinets</span>, where it is a <span class="keyword">safe haven</span>. I should have been <span class="keyword">crying</span> my eyes out too. Without realizing it, I seem to have found a way of life where, as long as I complete my daily <span class="keyword">school</span> tasks, I could go play the rest of the <span class="keyword">time</span>. I gradually get used to this way of life and become familiar with it, and it make my life very smooth. I am awarded for good <span class="keyword">academic performance</span> and obedience, by receiving the titles of "<span class="keyword">Junior Captain</span>", "<span class="keyword">Squadron Leader</span>" and "<span class="keyword">Three Good Student</span>". I also become one of the <span class="keyword">model students</span>. My life continues to be surrounded by a bunch of <span class="keyword">smiles</span>.
