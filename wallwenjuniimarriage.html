              毕业后经历了找工作和失业的恐惧后，生活终于开始安稳下来了，我也逐渐开始接受和习惯如其他人一样过着按部就班的日子。我们住在了一起，尝试过一些简单的活在当下的生活。即使只是一起吃早餐、聊天、做饭、看电影、躺在床上，都是美好的，我们像一对形影不离的双胞胎在共同编织着充满快乐和爱的生活。如果时间真的不再往前走，那多好。但时间仍然只会继续往前走。到了一定的年龄，似乎就要继续做对应该做的事情了。我们结婚了，但似乎不知道究竟结婚是什么。我们想尝试建立一个家庭，但似乎并不懂如何建立一个家庭。太多关系和任务围绕这我们，我们并不懂得如何处理，也许也不想去处理。某一天她跟我说，她看过外面的世界，那里有其他可能。我猜那是自由。我们卡在了某个地方，越想挣脱却束缚得越紧。

            After graduating and going through the fear of finding a job and losing my job, life finally starts to settle down and I gradually start to accept and get used to living a routine life like everyone else. We live together and try to live a simple life of living in the moment. Even just eating breakfast, talking to each other, cooking, watching movies, and lying in bed together, is wonderful. We are like twins inseparable weaving a life full of joy and love together. If time does not go forward, it will be great. But time will only continue to move forward. At a certain age, it seems like it's time to move on to the right things to do. We get married, but don't seem to know exactly what it is to get married. We want to try to start a family, but don't seem to know how to start one. There are too many relationships and tasks surrounding us that we don't know how to handle and maybe don't want to handle. One day she tells me that she has seen the outside world and that there are other possibilities there. I guess that is freedom. We are stuck somewhere, and the more we try to break free the tighter the bondage becomes.
